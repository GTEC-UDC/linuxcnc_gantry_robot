/**
 * Transform position to joints
 * The joints values are obtaining by finding the inverse of the
 * transformation used in calib_xyz_kins_forward:
 *
 * [p_0, p_1, p_2]^T = A * [j_0, j_1, j_2]^T +
 *                     B * [j_0^2, j_1^2, j_2^2]^T +
 *                     C
 *
 * Where p_i and j_i are the ith position and joint coordinates, respectively,
 * and ^T is the transpose operation.
 *
 * The joints positions are found using the Newton-Raphson method. The maximum
 * number of iterations and minimum tolerance of the method are controlled with
 * the max_iter and tol parameters, respectively. If min_bounds and max_bounds
 * parameters are not NULL then the obtained joints positions will be within the
 * specified bounds.
 *
 * The Jacobian matrix for this problem is:
 *
 * J = A + 2 * B * diag([j_0, j_1, j_2])
 *
 * To guarantee that the Newton-Raphson method always converges to the expected
 * result within the specified bounds the user should check that J is always
 * invertible within the bounds.
 *
 * Returns -1 if the joints could not be obtained due to the Jacobian
 * being non-invertible, 0 in other case.
